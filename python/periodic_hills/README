This folder contains the necessary tools to post-process simulations for the periodic_hills test cases.

It contains a number of python script which can be used to automatically post-process the case.
By default, the case post-processing can be fully ran by:
- Copying the data created by lethe to a lethe folder in the present directory
- Identifying the lethe file names the post-process in the postprocess_data.py script
- Running the postprocess_data.py script
- Running the data_in_geometry.py script

These scripts rely on a folder structure which will be created dynamically. The file paths can be dynamically changed.

Description of each files:
-------------------------

* breuer2009_data_comparison.py:
Compares two different sources for the data of the Breuer article. This code is intended mostly as a verification and should not be used when
post-processing simulation data.

* post_process_data.py 
Script that extracts the data out a lethe simulations and prepares the csv and graphics used to compare the exprimental and reference
results with the simulation results. The CSV data for Lethe should be prepared by outputting to a single csv file the averaged
velocity and reynolds stressed. This can be done by using the spreadsheet view in paraview and exporting this spreadsheet.
All the csv files to be post-processed should be in the lethe subfolder of the present root. The name of each file and their
associated label should also be hard-coded within the python script.

* plot_data_with_geometry.py
Script that plots the pertinent data superposed with the periodic hill geometry
