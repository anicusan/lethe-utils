This folder contains the necessary tools to post-process simulations for the periodic_hills test cases.

It contains a number of python script which can be used to automatically post-process the case.
By default, the case post-processing can be fully ran by:
- Copying the data created by Lethe in a csv form to a lethe folder in the present directory
- Identifying the Lethe file names to post-process in the python scripts to be ran
- Running the post_processing_new.py (formerly postprocess_data.py) script
- Running the plot_data_with_geometry_new.py (formely plot_data_with_geometry.py) script
- Running the near_wall_processing.py script
- Running the y_plus_on_geometry.py script

These scripts rely on a folder structure which will be created dynamically. The file paths can be dynamically changed.

Description of each files:
-------------------------

* breuer2009_data_comparison.py:
Script that compares two different sources for the data of the Breuer article. This code is intended mostly as a verification and should
not be used when post-processing simulation data.

* post_processing_new.py (formerly postprocess_data.py)
Script that extracts the data out the Lethe simulations and prepares the csv and graphics used to compare the experimental and reference
results with the simulation results. The csv data for Lethe should be prepared by outputting to a single csv file the averaged velocity and
reynolds stresses. This can be done by using the spreadsheet view in ParaView and exporting this spreadsheet. All the csv files to be
post-processed should be in the lethe subfolder of the present root. The name of each file and their associated label should also be
hard-coded within the python script.

* plot_data_with_geometry_new.py (formerly plot_data_with_geometry.py)
Script that plots the pertinent data superposed with the periodic hill geometry. Note that the plot_data_with_geometry_new.py requires the
output csvs from post_processing_new.py, and the former script plot_data_with_geometry.py requires the output csvs from postprocess_data.py.

* near_wall_processing.py
Script that outputs the reattachment point, average y+ and maximum y+ along the lower wall for Lethe simulations, and plots y+. The name of
each Lethe file should be hard-coded within the python script as with post_processing_new.py.

* y_plus_on_geometry.py
Script that plots y+ superimposed over the periodic hill geometry.
