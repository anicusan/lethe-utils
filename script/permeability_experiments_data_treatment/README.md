# Permeability experimental data treatment

This folder contains a Python script to postprocess experimental permeability data obtained from the experimental setup. 

- `permeability_data_treatment` is the Python script.
- `permeability_data_treatment_parameters` contains columns with the information of each case to be treated.
- `/data/` should contain one file per experiment. The file has to have different columns, and can be generated with the software used to manage the pump and sensors during the experiments.
